# Contributing to Aluminium

## Welcome to the Future of Test Automation!

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Aluminium! As an experimental AI-powered test automation framework, we are pioneering new approaches to make testing more intuitive and robust. Your expertise and passion can help shape this emerging technology.

As a software tester, I have seen how the right tools can transform quality assurance. Aluminium aims to be that transformative tool by leveraging AI to simplify test interactions and assertions.

## Project Understanding

Before contributing, please review:

- Our [README.md](https://github.com/automatealchemist/alumnium#) to understand Aluminium's vision: creating higher-level abstractions for test automation that simplify web page interactions and strengthen assertion mechanisms
- Our experimental status - we're in early development and value innovative approaches
- The core functionality that uses natural language processing to interpret testing commands

## Finding Your Contribution Opportunity

- Explore the [open issues](https://github.com/yourusername/aluminium/) to find tasks matching your interests
- We will be glad if you help us with :
  - Improving test coverage for edge cases  
  - Enhancing documentation and examples  
  - Exploring more natural language prompts for test generation  
  - Reporting usability issues or unexpected test behavior  
  - Creating sample projects using Aluminium

## Contribution Workflow

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/aluminium.git
cd aluminium

# Set up development environment
pipx install poetry
poetry install

# Configure AI provider access as mentioned in [README.md](https://github.com/automatealchemist/alumnium#)
```

### 2. Development Guidelines

When working on Aluminium:

- Follow the existing code style and patterns
- Ensure compatibility with the Selenium ecosystem
- Document new functionality with clear examples
- Test your changes using the provided commands:
  ```bash
  poetry run python -i demo.py  # REPL for quick testing
  poetry run behave             # Gherkin examples
  poetry run pytest             # Pytest examples
  ```

### 3. Pull Request Process

1. **Create a focused branch** for your contribution
2. **Write meaningful commit messages** explaining your changes
3. **Include tests** that verify your contribution works as expected
4. **Update documentation** if you're adding or changing features
5. **Submit your PR** with a clear description of what it accomplishes

## AI-First Testing Philosophy

As contributors to an AI-powered testing tool, we value:

- **Natural language over rigid syntax** - Tests should be readable by non-technical stakeholders
- **Adaptability over brittleness** - Tests should withstand UI changes
- **Intent over implementation** - Focus on what should happen, not how it happens
- **Context awareness** - Testing tools should understand the application under test

## Community Guidelines

- Be respectful and constructive in all interactions
- Share knowledge generously - we're all learning in this emerging field
- Value diverse perspectives - they lead to more robust solutions
- Ask questions when unclear - clarity benefits everyone

## For First-Time Contributors

If you're new to open-source or AI-powered testing:

1. Try running the demo and experimenting with the Alumni API
2. Start with documentation improvements or simple bug fixes
3. Ask questions in discussions or comments
4. Use the REPL (poetry run python -i demo.py) to explore functionality

## Recognition

All contributors will be acknowledged in our releases and documentation. As an experimental project on the cutting edge of testing technology, your contributions here represent pioneering work in the field.
